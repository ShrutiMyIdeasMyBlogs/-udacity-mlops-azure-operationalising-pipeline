# Operationalizing Machine Learning Project-2
This project can be divided into two parts:
1. First section involves the model creation for the banking marketing data.It uses the AutoML functionality of Azure Machine learning i.e no/low code platform.
2. In the second part of the project, the python SDK has be used for pipeline creation for model training on the same dataset which has been used in part1.
